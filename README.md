# antif4.com website

This is the website for www.antif4.com. 

Technically, it is a hugo site, with a custom theme (antif4) using webtui css. 

## Getting Started

1. Install hugo and node
2. Clone repo
3. npm i
4. npm run build

At this point, the website will exist in ./public/

If you wish to run the dev server you can use `npm run server` to run a dev server to test out changes locally. This server will automatically update when you change a file locally, so you shouldn't have to rebuild the server after each change.
