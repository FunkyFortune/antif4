## The People Behind antif4.com

Hi! I'm Eian and one of the people behind antif4.com. I've enjoyed and learned a lot from a decades long career in technology and I'm excited to bring all that learning and experience to antif4.com. 

When I quit my job at AWS in 2024, I had the thought that it might be me quitting my ~25  year tech career. But now, I realize that it was also the end of my direct involvement in a toxic work culture and technofascism. I wish I had done it sooner. 
 
I am not a household name. But that does not mean my impact has been insignificant. There are thousands of little men like me that have quietly and with moral impunity siphoned the wealth and resources from you to give to the technofascist elite. 
 
I have seen and been an active part in the birth, growth, and corruption of modern computer technology from the days of BBS/fidonet and freenet dialup connections to AI hosted cloud services writing our children’s book reports. I had multiple patents before I was 30, built and lead engineering teams on multiple continents and have received industry awards. 
 
I’ve worked at multiple household names. Code I have written has been used by and directly impacted millions of people in their smartphones. I have had a direct impact in setting the price of hundreds of thousands of renters at the largest apartment mega corps and the price of your hotel room in Las Vegas. 
 
I don’t say this to boast. I only say this so that you take what I say seriously. I’m not a somebody, but I’m not a nobody. 
 
My corporate career was, on its whole, fascist. US culture, laws, and institutions support and are shaped to produce technofascism. I do not believe there is a way to be a moral actor on the inside. The fruits of your labor ultimately produce, and entrench, more fascism.  I fucking hate fascism. 
 
So here I am. I don’t know what’s next and that freaks me out. But I don’t have much emotional energy these days to worry about that. Every time I turn my head I see a fucking fascist. And that is scary. So, hi, I’m Eian. Let’s do something about the fascism, yeah? I’m in.
