Hello! Welcome to our little corner of the internet. We hope that you will find a place for yourself here and be comfortable.

So, what are we doing about this? 

**Email**

Status: *Alpha*

Email is the backbone of internet identity. Without safe, secure, and private email it is impossible to have trust in any of the other services htat you sign up for. 
 * Your email is yours and your data is yours. 
 * No ads. No AI. The only scanning we do of your email is to prevent spam and only using industry standard non-AI tools. 
 * In addition to email, we will provide: 
  * Safe, secure, and private mailing lists
  * Custom domains

**Photo & File Backup** 

Status: *In Planning*

Many of us take advantage of providers such as Apple or Google to store our photos. 

**Community** 

Status: *Our future vision*

How is the company different? 

First, we do not directly charge for any of our services. These services are provided for free, as we are able to provide them.

What is my storage quota? 

At antif4.com individual users do not have storage limits or quotas. You are free to use as much storage or bandwidth as you require. 

However, remember that storage is a community resource. When antif4.com runs out of storage, everybody runs out of storage.
