## Why now? 

### How does antif4.com view the world?

### That's a lot. Shouldn't we give to organizations? 

## The Company 

### Is antif4.com political? 

No. We are not attempting to serve a political agenda nor do we consider ourselves a political group. In so far as "political" means intentionally working to further political power. 

However, we very much are a company comprised of individuals who feel very passionately about political topics. Even further, we believe that it is a moral duty for us to allow our politics to influence our work and vice versa. 

So, no, we are not a political company or organization and are not interested in engaging with or furthering any specific political organization. However, we have many feelings driven from compassion and empathy for all humans that require us to act or speak in a certain way. If others find this political, we are ok with that. 

### Does antif4.com condone violence? 

No. antif4.com believes in non-violent direct action. 

> Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such creative tension that a community that has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seems to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. 

### How is the company different?

First, we do not directly charge for any of our services. These services are provided for free, as we are able to provide them.

## Email

### Why is email the first service for antif4.com?

An internet journey begins with an email address. Without an email address it is impossible to sign up for and engage with any kind of site. From shopping, to an electronic library card, to chat about your favorite hobby, if you want to do it online, you need an email address. 

Because of this, in striving to take back control of our private online lives, we believe that email is the foundation of all future work. We want to have an email service where we can trust our email provider to not sell our data to ad networks, to not allow our email data to be used to train AI, and to truly keep our data private. *But going futher, we want an email provider that truly cares about its users as people.* People of all types must be kept as safe as possible online.

Also, email is a very old technology, and while that doesn't mean it's easy, it does mean it is straight forward, as far as knowing what is required to get it started. 

These are the primary reasons we chose email as the intial service for us to offer. 

### Are there any secondary benefits to starting with email? 

Yes. Similar to the early internet, once we have email, we will be able to host antif4.com mailing lists. These mailing lists will be the first time that our community is able to chat openly amongst themselves, and we are excited to get to this point. 

### What is my storage quota?

At antif4.com users do not have storage limits or quotas. You are free to use as much storage or bandwidth as you require.

However, storage isn't magical or free. It is a community resource that everybody sharing the site is impacted by running out of. When antif4.com runs out of storage, everybody runs out of storage.

### How can I tell how much storage antif4.com has?
