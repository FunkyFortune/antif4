How is the company different?
First, we do not directly charge for any of our services. These services are provided for free, as we are able to provide them.
What is my storage quota?
At antif4.com individual users do not have storage limits or quotas. You are free to use as much storage or bandwidth as you require.
However, remember that storage is a community resource. When antif4.com runs out of storage, everybody runs out of storage.
