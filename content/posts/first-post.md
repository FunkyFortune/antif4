Several months ago, antif4.com hadn't fully taken form. Me and close friends would gather around food and drinks, and lament the state of the world. Everything going on was just *so much*. It was so hard to understand how we, as just a few individuals, could make a difference. 

Sure, as we had been doing, and as we will continue doing, we could give our time and money to existing non-profits and political organizations. That felt too insufficient, and too immpersonal. 

And that brings us now, today, to antif4.com. Leveraging our experience as technologists, computer programmers, journalists, and most importantly, as humans, we are trying out somethign new and building a different kind of company.
